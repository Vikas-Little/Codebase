Packages - Adding more functions to LaTeX!

We can use packages in LaTeX to add more functions.

LaTeX offers a lot of functions by default, but in some situations it can become in handy to use so called packages. To import a package in LaTeX, 
you simply add the \usepackage directive to the preamble of your document:

\documentclass{article}

\usepackage{PACKAGENAME}

\begin{document}

...

There are countless packages, all for different purposes.

To typeset math, LaTeX offers (among others) an environment called equation.

Everything inside this environment will be printed in math mode, a special typesetting environment for math.

LaTeX also takes care of equation numbers for us:

\documentclass{article}

\begin{document}

\begin{equation}
  f(x) = x^2
\end{equation}

\end{document}

The automatic numbering is a useful feature, but sometimes it's necessary to remove them for auxiliary calculations.

LaTeX doesn't allow this by default, now we want to include a package that does:

\documentclass{article}

\usepackage{amsmath}

\begin{document}

\begin{equation*}
  f(x) = x^4
\end{equation*}

\end{document}

Now we get the same output as before, only the equation number is removed.

Some Useful points:

1. Packages add new functions to LaTeX.
2. All packages must be included in the preamble.
3. Packages add features such as support for pictures, links and bibliography.
