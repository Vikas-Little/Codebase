Some basic git instructions are as follows:

1) git clone https://github.com/Vikas-Little/Codebase.git </path/to/folder_name>
   - to clone the repository from the server into your local folder </path/to/folder_name>

2) git status (to check the status of the present directory against the repository)

3) git add <file_name> (to add an untracked file <file_name> into the repository)

4) git add </path/to/folder>/* e.g. git add LightHTTPServer/* (to add all contents of the directory </path/to/folder> into the repository)

5) git config --global user.email "vikas.little@gmail.com" (to configure the repository owners's email)

6) git config --global user.name "Vikas Upadhyay" (to configure the repository owner's name)

7) git commit -a -m "<message>"
   (to commit (save) changes to the respository; <message> should describe briefly what changes in the repository are being committed)

8) git push (to push changes on to the server)

9) git pull (to fetch the latest version of the code from the repository)

10) git delete <file_name> (to delete <file_name> from the repository)
