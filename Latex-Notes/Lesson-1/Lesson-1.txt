Your first LaTeX document!

The basic layout of a LATEX file!

Creating documents with LaTeX is simple and fun. In contrast to Word, you start off with a plain text file (.tex file) which contains LaTeX code 
and the actual content (i.e. text). LaTeX uses control statements, which define how your content should be formatted. Before you can see what the 
final result looks like, the LaTeX compiler will take your .tex file and compile it into a .pdf file.

A basic example document can be created with the following code:

\documentclass{article}

\begin{document}
 Hello World!
\end{document}

Once you translated this code into a PDF document, you will find the text:

 Hello World!

along with the page number at the bottom, which is added automatically when using the article class.

Let us now take a closer look at how the magic happens.

As you can see, you will find a few statements beginning with a backslash \ in the code example above. This tells LaTeX that this is not actual 
text, that you want to see printed in your document, but instead is an instruction or command for the LaTeX compiler.

All commands share the following structure:

 \commandname{option}

The first part indicates the name of the command and the second part in braces sets an option for this command. The options vary from command to 
command.

Most of the time, the commands are pretty self-explanatory.

Now let's take a little closer look at the command \documentclass{article}.

The command is obviously named documentclass and it does exactly that, it sets the document class (to article).

LaTeX uses document classes, to influence the overall layout of your document.

For instance, there's one class to layout articles, one class to layout books (called book) and many more, which we probably don't need.

The command that involves a \begin and \end statement is not a command, but defines an environment. An environment is simply an area of your 
document where certain typesetting rules apply. It is possible (and usually necessary) to have multiple environments in a document, but it is 
imperative the document environment is the topmost environment.

The following code shows how environments can be used:

% Valid:

\begin{document}
  \begin{environment1}
    \begin{environment2}
    \end{environment2}
  \end{environment1}
\end{document}


%Invalid:

\begin{document}
  \begin{environment1}
    \begin{environment2}
  \end{environment1}
    \end{environment2}
\end{document}

% Invalid:

\begin{document}
  \begin{environment1}
\end{document}
  \end{environment1}

% Also invalid:

\begin{environment}
  \begin{document}
  \end{document}
\end{environment}

While it is possible to define your own environments, it is very likely that the environment you desire already exists.

LaTeX already comes with a few predefined environments and even more come in so called packages.

Let's try out a few more commands to make our document more interesting:

\documentclass{article}

\title{My first document}
\date{18-01-17}
\author{Vikash Upadhyay}

\begin{document}

\maketitle

\newpage

 Some content...

\end{document}

Obviously the statements \title, \date and \author are not within the the document environment, so they will not directly show up in our document.

The area before our main document is called preamble.

In this specific example we use it to set up the values for the \maketitle command for later use in our document. This command will create a titlepage
for us.

The \newpage command speaks for itself.

If we now compile again, we will see a nicely formatted title page, but we can spot a page number at the bottom of our title page.

What if we decide, that actually, we don't want to have that page number showing up there. We can remove it, by telling LaTeX to hide the page
number for our first page.

This can be done by adding the \pagenumbering{gobble} command and then changing it back to \pagenumbering{arabic} on the next page numbers like so:

\documentclass{article}

\title{My first document}
\date{18-01-17}
\author{Vikash Upadhyay}

\begin{document}

\pagenumbering{gobble}
\maketitle

\newpage
\pagenumbering{arabic}
 
 Some content...

\end{document}

Some Useful Points:

1. A document has a preamble and document part.

2. The document environment must be defined.

3. Commands begin with a backslash \, environments have a begin and end tag.

Useful settings for pagenumbering: gobble - no numbers, arabic - arabic numbers, roman - roman numbers.
