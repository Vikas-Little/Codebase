Structuring your document - Adding paragraphs and sections!

We have created a very basic document in the previous lesson, but when writing a paper, it's necessary to structure the content into logic units.

To achieve this, LaTeX offers us commands to generate section headings and number them automatically.

The commands to create section headings are straightforward:

\section{}
\subsection{}
\subsubsection{}

\paragraph{}
\subparagraph{}

The section commands are numbered and will appear in the table of contents of your document.

Paragraphs aren't numbered and won't show in the table of contents.

Hierarchy of all sectioning elements-

The hierarchical structure of all elements can be seen as:

1 Section

 Hello World!

1.1 Subsection

 Structuring a document is easy!

1.1.1 Subsubsection

 More text.

Paragraph Some more text.

	Subparagraph Even more text.

2 Another Section

We can incorporate the above structural hierarchy of all elements as:

\documentclass{article}

\title{My first document}
\date{18-01-17}
\author{Vikash Upadhyay}

\begin{document}

\pagenumbering{gobble}
\maketitle

\newpage
\pagenumbering{arabic}

\section{Section}
 Hello World!

\subsection{Subsection}
 Structuring a document is easy!

\subsubsection{Subsubsection}
 More text.

\paragraph{Paragraph}
 Some more text.

\subparagraph{Subparagraph}
 Even more text.

\section {Another section}

\newpage

 Some content...

\end{document}

It's very easy to structure documents into sections using LaTeX. This feature also exists in Word, but most people don't use it properly.

In LaTeX, it is very effortless to have consistent formatting throughout your paper.

Some Useful Points:

1. LaTeX uses the commands \section, \subsection and \subsubsection to define sections in your document.

2. The sections will have successive numbers and appear in the table of contents.

3. Paragraphs are not numbered and thus don't appear in the table of contents.
